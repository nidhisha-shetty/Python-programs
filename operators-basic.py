Operators: Used in loops

x=2 y=3

#Arithmetic operators
x+y
x-y
x*y
x/y

#Assignment operators
x=x+2     // x+=2
x=x-2     // x-=2
x=x*2     // x*=2
x=x/2     // x/=2
x,y = 2,3 //assigning values to multiple variables

#Logical operators
and
or
not
x<3 and y<4 --> True
x<3 and y<2 --> False
x<3 or y<2 --> True
x<3 or y<4 --> True
x=True
not x --> False

#Relational operators
a<b (check if a is less than to b)
a>b (check if a is greater than b)
a==b (check if a is equal to b)
a<=b (check if a is less than equalt to b)
a>=b (check if a is greater than equalt to b)
a!=b (check if a is not equalt to b)

#Unary opeators
n=5
-n will result into -5

//swapping values of variables without using third variable
a,b = b,a
